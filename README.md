# Week7-train
This homework is about creating a dynamic train schedule that can give us live ETA's on our schedule. We can add trains based on the input we give our form.

# Techs used
Firebase - so we can log our data through a database
jquery - to control our DOM events
bootstrap - for page styling
MomentJS - To add our current time and give us updates on our train schedule

# things needed to be done
fixing the train schedule to show correct info
fixing the form data and have it display on our table
